Hi! I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at MIT majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
My research focuses on machine learning and developing robust and efficient algorithms driven by clinical problems.
Applications include motion-robust 3D rendering of the human brain, 
real-time quality assessment in MR scans as well as pose estimation and motion characterization of fetuses.
I am advised by Prof. [Elfar Adalsteinsson](https://www.rle.mit.edu/people/directory/elfar-adalsteinsson/) 
and collaborate closely with Prof. [Polina Golland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) 
and Prof. [P. Ellen Grant](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W4dqZ7EAAAAJ).

I also did summer internships at Google and Meta, working on automated Ads bidding and large-scale video recommendation systems respectively.

Prior to MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2018. 
I also spent a summer as a research assistant at Stanford, 
where I was advised by Prof. [John Pauly](https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/) and Prof. [Greg Zaharchuk](https://profiles.stanford.edu/greg-zaharchuk).
